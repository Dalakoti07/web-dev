## What's `this`?
Having set aside various incorrect assumptions, let us now turn our attention to how the `this` mechanism really works.

We said earlier that `this` is not an author-time binding but a runtime binding. It is contextual based on the conditions of the function's invocation. `this` binding has nothing to do with where a function is declared, but has instead everything to do with the manner in which the function is called.

When a function is invoked, an activation record, otherwise known as an execution context, is created. This record contains information about where the function was called from (the call-stack), how the function was invoked, what parameters were passed, etc. One of the properties of this record is the `this` reference which will be used for the duration of that function's execution.


**Let's try to illustrate the motivation and utility of `this`:**
```js
function identify() {
	return this.name.toUpperCase();
}

function speak() {
	var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify.call( this );
	console.log( greeting );
}

var me = {
	name: "Kyle"
};

var you = {
	name: "Reader"
};

identify.call( me ); // KYLE
identify.call( you ); // READER

speak.call( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE
speak.call( you ); // Hello, I'm READER
```

## Its Scope
The next most common misconception about the meaning of `this` is that it somehow refers to the function's scope. It's a tricky question, because in one sense there is some truth, but in the other sense, it's quite misguided.

To be clear, `this` does not, in any way, refer to a function's lexical scope. It is true that internally, scope is kind of like an object with properties for each of the available identifiers. But the scope "object" is not accessible to JavaScript code. It's an inner part of the Engine's implementation.

Consider code which attempts (and fails!) to cross over the boundary and use `this` to implicitly refer to a function's lexical scope:

```js
function foo() {
	var a = 2;
	this.bar();
}

function bar() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

foo(); //undefined
```

## Review (TL;DR)
`this` binding is a constant source of confusion for the JavaScript developer who does not take the time to learn how the mechanism actually works. Guesses, trial-and-error, and blind copy-n-paste from Stack Overflow answers is not an effective or proper way to leverage `this` important `this` mechanism.

To learn `this`, you first have to learn what `this` is not, despite any assumptions or misconceptions that may lead you down those paths. `this` is neither a reference to the function itself, nor is it a reference to the function's lexical scope.

`this` is actually a binding that is made when a function is invoked, and what it references is determined entirely by the call-site where the function is called.
