episode 1 - basic of canvas
episode 2 - (Trignometry) create sin wave
episode 3 - (Trignometry) create bounce, shape transition, and opacity effect using sin wave
episode 4 - (Trignometry) move objects in circular path, elliptical path, lissajous curves
episode 5 - (Trignometry) move arrow as per move movement
episode 7 - (vectors) a helper js file nothing visual
episode 8 - (vectors) scatter dots from center of screen using vector
episode 9 - (gravity basics)
    - fireworks with gravity effect
    - a particle on bottom left, apply acceleration force on it and see it moving
episode 10 - spaceship and acceleration example on keyboard btn press
episode 11 - Acceleration: solar system, earth revolving around sun
episode 12 - edge Handling 
    - remove them from array so that computation is not wasted
    - regenerate to show fountain like effect
    - bouncing and bouncing with energy loss
episode 13 - friction implemented in 2 ways; using vector; using multiplication
episode 14 - collision detection in 
    - circle circle
    - circle point
    - rect point
    - rect rect 
episode 15 - 
    - spring motion where spring would be at center of screen but mass would be assigned to any random position in space
    - added mouse event such that on mouse location ,new spring location is decided 
episode 16 -
    - spring advance example
episode 18 - refactoring the code for particle js
    - mass bounded with more than 1 spring
    - 100 particles are gravitated toward 2 sun like objects
episode 19 - bezier curve examples
episode 20 - 
    - touch top of curve
    - multi-points bezier curve, means having n points where n>3 (idea is to create curves in parts, using mid points)
    - difference between bezier curve and our multi curve (which says that always use bezier curve 
    function when having 4 points and because that curve would be more accurate as compare to our approach of using mid
    point approach)
episode 21:
    - bitmap collision detection
episode 22
    - 3d gallery
    - 3d coming alphabets
episode 23
    - some of the z axis transition was flaky and thats why we sorted it
    - bubble effect
    - spiral animation
